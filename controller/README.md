# Controller

Originally I wanted to also write Rust on the controller side but for Reasons(tm) I wrote it in good old Arduino flavored C++.

So, `arduino-es32` contains code that you can open in the Arduino IDE and flash on any (I guess?) esp32 board. I personally was using the NodeMCU esp32 aka ESP32 devkit v1.

In the Future(tm) I want to also have the code for the ESP32-c3-Rust1 but I have to wait for my board to arrive to test it.
