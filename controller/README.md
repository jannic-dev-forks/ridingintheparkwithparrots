# Controller

Originally I wanted to also write Rust on the controller side but for because I bought the wrong board first I wrote/build the first version in good old Arduino flavored C++.

So, `arduino-es32` contains code that you can open in the Arduino IDE and flash on any (I guess?) esp32 board. I personally was using the NodeMCU esp32 aka ESP32 devkit v1.

Update: my new board arrived, so `esp32-c3-rust` contains the setup for the board of the same name. Still a work in progress.
